### Focus

> TODO: focus

> A short blurb highlighting one worker-led effort (a strike, an appeal, etc.)
> Another blurb highlighting something less known/underrepresented in the Bay Area or US.
> A longer blurb with commentary about “What this all means” (our analysis),
> and ideally with take-aways that would-be allies can use (not quite a call to action)

### In the news

> TODO: news
>
> A curated collection of 3-10 links to other efforts around the world or relevant articles.

### Song of the week

> TODO: song
>
> A brief excerpt of lyrics from an inspiration song
>
